## PicPerf WordPress Plugin

[PicPerf](http://picperf.dev/) is a service for automatically optimizing, reformating, and aggressively caching your website's images just by tweaking the URLs you're already using. This WordPress plugin will take care of that part too, making it even easier to upgrade your image performance. 

This plugin is currently in development, but will be officially released soon. 

For more information on PicPerf, dig into [the documentation](http://picperf.dev/docs).
